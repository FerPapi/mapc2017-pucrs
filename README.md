# PUCRS code for the MAPC of 2017

To run our code first download the latest release, extract it to a folder, and then import that folder as an existing project to Eclipse.

First, run the server in a terminal (e.g., java -jar server-2017-0.2-jar-withependencies.jar --monitor), and then in Eclipse right click "pucrs-mapc2017.jcm" and select "Run JaCaMo Application" to connect our agents.

If you wish to run the server, and our code all with one click, just right-click test/pucrs.agentcontest2017/ScenarioRunServer.java file, "Run as", "jUnit Test".
